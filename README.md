Robotic Hand Control using Flex Sensors

Abstract :
    This project focuses on developing a robotic hand that responds to human finger movements. Instead of using an EMG sensor, the system utilizes flex sensors to detect finger bending and translate it into mechanical movements. The detected signals are processed by an Arduino to control servo motors. This system is designed for remote handling of hazardous chemicals in chemical plants, reducing human exposure to dangerous substances. It offers an affordable, easy-to-use, and customizable solution for industrial safety.
